# AIPathfinding
A small pathfinding thing I decided to do one day. 

It is based off of a small simulation I found, where a few ai 'humans' would go around cutting down trees. 
They would then build a house when they had enough resources.

My program is similar in that there are ai 'humans' that will move towards a tree and will remove it.
I have also included an enemy character which chases after the human characters.
